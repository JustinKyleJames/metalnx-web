# Docker Testing Framework for Metalnx 

This testing framework provides a disposable docker image of a running metalnx, including the metalnx database. This arrangement is meant to use the iRODS configuration found in the [Jargon Docker Testing Framework] (https://github.com/DICE-UNC/jargon/blob/master/DOCKERTEST.md), utilizing the same testing properties and setup facilities across all the services.
