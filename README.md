## Version: 2.0.0-RELEASE
## Git Tag: 2.0.0-RELEASE
## Date: Oct 25, 2018

Metalnx is a web application designed to work alongside the [iRODS - Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System](http://www.irods.org). It provides a graphical UI that can help simplify most administration,
collection management, and metadata management tasks removing the need to memorize the long list of icommands.

### Install Metalnx

Note that this fork adds a schema configuration and migration tool to set up and migrate the database over versions. This
actually is a start of a more formalized irods-ext database which will evolve to support an implementation of virtual collections,
metadata templates, and the like. See the README.md in the metalnx-tools subproject for details on setting up and migrating the database schema.

Check out [Getting-Started](https://github.com/Metalnx/metalnx-web/wiki/Getting-Started) for installation instructions.
